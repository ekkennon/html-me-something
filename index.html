			<article id="qb"><h3>QBASIC</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">Mid 90's</p>
				<p id="why">After installing DOS one day I was looking around to see if there was anything interesting and found something called QBASIC.EXE and remembered seeing a book laying around the house with the same title.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">Found a con of using the old BASIC languages after writing a program with a timer based on the processor speed, because the processor I had was much faster than what was around when the book was written. My first taste of programming got me hooked.</p>
			</article><a href="#top"><hr/></a>
			
			<article id="vb"><h3>Visual Basic</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">High School</p>
				<p id="why">This was the only programming language offered at my high school and it seemed like the natural next step for me at the time.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">Came out of this with a better understanding of the basic concepts and an introduction to common mistakes (such as infinite loops).</p>
			</article><a href="#top"><hr/></a>

			<article id="itt"><h3>ITT Tech</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2001 - 2006</p>
				<p id="why">At the time tech schools seemed like a better option than traditional schools because they are more focused on the skills employers wanted to see.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">After getting my Associate's degree and being halfway to getting my Bachelor's, looking at my debt and not getting interviews I got discouraged. Quit school and gave up programming.</p>
			</article><a href="#top"><hr/></a>

			<article id="cpp"><h3>C++</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2010</p>
				<p id="why">A friend of mine got me interested in programming again. He would tell me about the GUI C++ applications he was writing. I got an itch to try it programming again and when I would ask for advice he always had suggestions.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">I was writing all the code in Notepad++ and using makefiles to help with compiling. Toward the end of a year I was starting to use SDL and OpenGL for 2D and 3D graphics, but quickly realized this isn't a huge interest of mine.</p>
			</article><a href="#top"><hr/></a>

			<article id="droid"><h3>Java for Android</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2011</p>
				<p id="why">While working with C++ I would think of apps I would like to have for free on my iPod Touch. Due to the lower cost I decided to try writing Android apps.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">This was a steep learning curve for me, having forgotten most of what I had learned about while at ITT Tech. I was familiar with some syntax as I had been writing in C++ but since the only thing I really understood about Object Oriented programming was that an object is a class and it is a way to separate out code, I did have trouble getting up to speed with reading Java. On top of that I was trying to understand the Android API. Because of this experience I have the ability to learn any languages, concepts, techniques, and API's that I put time into learning.</p>

			<article id="motech"><h3>MO Tech</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2012 - 2015</p>
				<p id="why">I heard an ad on the radio for this school. They had a very high job placement rate and I thought with my experiences in the past 2 years I would be able to show an employer that I have the skills they are looking for.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">The school closed before I earned my degree but while there I was able to take more advanced classes than I had before. Design patterns theory, Java 3 with Spring and Hibernate, Microsoft ASP with the MVC pattern.</p>
			</article><a href="#top"><hr/></a>

			<article id="bjc"><h3>BJC</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2012 - 2015</p>
				<p id="why">At this time, BJC HealthCare had something called the PRN Program. Made for people with little or no experience, a project manager could ask for an available PRN to work for a short period of time (up to 6 months) on a task that didn't require high level skills. The project manager saved money vs. hiring a contractor and the PRN got experience and networking opportunities. Many students from my school were in, or had been in, this program.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">I worked with the testing (support) team for the only in-house made software at BJC. I gained experience in manual regression testing and was thrilled everytime I found a bug missed by others. After several failed attempts to remain with the testing or development team I moved to another project. My new supervisors, knowing I was in school for programming, gave me an opportunity to use my skills where I gained valuable experience to apply for an official programming job.</p>

			<article id="qa"><h3>Software QA Engineer</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2015 &amp; 2016</p>
				<p id="why">This seemed like a great opportunity to gain skills, knowledge, and experience.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">I did get out of this even more than I expected. However, that took place, in total, in about a quarter of my time in this role. Most of my time spent here was writing the same code repeatedly, when I had code to write. I realized the best way for me to get what I am looking for was to go back to school.</p>
			</article><a href="#top"><hr/></a>

			<article id="cert"><h3>C Certification</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2016</p>
				<p id="why">This is way of showing employers that I have skills. Risky because some see programming certifications as something for those who don't have the skills to write code but are good at memorizing or book learning. I am not good at either of those but was able to study hard and pass the test.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">To me it isn't necessary to get as deep into a language for most programmers as a certification requires but it gave me an idea of what to expect if I decide to get a Java certification.</p>
			</article><a href="#top"><hr/></a>

			<article id="cs"><h3>CS Degree</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2017 to present</p>
				<p id="why">I would like to show potential employers that I have the skills to get the degree.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">I am starting with the gen ed classes but have started looking at the Computer Science section on Khan Academy.</p>
			</article><a href="#top"><hr/></a>

			<article id="lc"><h3>LaunchCode (LC101)</h3><img src="" />
				<p id="when">2017 Jan - Jun</p>
				<p id="why">This was suggested to me by a former co-worker with the idea that it will be easier for them to place me in an apprenticeship if I've taken a class.</p>
				<br/>
				<p id="what">Starting Unit 2 and everything up to now has been review. Soon we will get into things I've never done before.</p>
